Repo for my website?

Hello,

My name is Angel Moses Ochoa,
this is my README for my repo Website!

The goal of this repo/project is to create the files that will be the building blocks of my website,
as well as establishing an easy place to host the files for them to be reviewed,
and possibly edited!

The repo is available publicly,
honestly because I'm to -BLANK- broke to afford to make it public,
college student life problems,
and also because it makes sharing the files easier anyway.

It also serves as a public way to broadcast my coding skills improvement overtime!

The repo will update ever so often when I have the time to edit the files and push them to be reviewed!

Thank you for reading!

Angel "shortalay" Moses Ochoa
